# Local-Food-Wastage-Management-System
“Built a Food Management System leveraging Python, SQL, and Power BI to analyze provider–receiver data, track availability, and optimize food distribution.”

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Food Management System** is designed to streamline the process of managing food providers and receivers, optimizing food distribution, and reducing food waste. The project leverages data analysis, visualization, and reporting techniques to provide actionable insights for better decision-making.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Track and manage food providers (restaurants, grocery stores, etc.) and receivers (NGOs, individuals).  
- Analyze food availability and demand across different cities.  
- Visualize trends and distributions to support efficient food allocation.  
- Reduce food waste by matching surplus with demand.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Visualization Tools:** Power BI, Excel  
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

## 🔑 Key Features  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure dataset accuracy.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights.  
- Dashboards for real-time tracking of food providers, receivers, and availability.  
- Machine learning models to analyze demand and optimize distribution.  

---

## 📊 Insights & Findings  
- Identified cities with the highest number of food listings and demand.  
- Determined the most active food providers and receivers.  
- Analyzed surplus vs. demand to recommend efficient distribution strategies.  
- Highlighted opportunities to reduce food waste and improve allocation.
